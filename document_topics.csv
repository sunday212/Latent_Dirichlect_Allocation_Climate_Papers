this paper analyses in a holistic manner the impact on carbon dioxide and harmful emissions from transient compression ignition engines when increasing the renewable content of the fuel to meet the renewable energy targets the analysis is based on a model developed from a rigorous design of experiment methodology used to determine the complex relationship between renewable fuel content and exhaust emissions (carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides) unlike other studies the results were collected from a transient engine cycle the world harmonised light vehicle test procedure rather than steady state conditions thus the results are more applicable to the real world

the results generally show that as the amount of ethanol is increased then the nox and co emissions decrease compared to current pump diesel increasing the biodiesel content generally increases the co and co2 emissions from the engine for practical reasons a ternary blend is required to minimise the diesel engine emissions whilst meeting the uk‚Äôs future renewable content target a blend of b24e10 was found to be the optimum compromise between renewable content and engine emissions however for this to be achieved the uk will have to invest in second and third generation ethanol"

another objective of the current work is to develop a hands-on approach to extend classroom teaching of vibration-isolation using soas made out of fettuccine strands and modeling clay the frequencies of the oscillators in the array are tuned by varying the length of each strand and the mass of the modeling clay attached to its tip uncertainty in dynamic properties of such oscillators often results in mistuned soas with non-uniform frequency response function therefore designing and testing fettuccine-based soas allows students to handle cases when structural uncertainties arise in engineering systems additionally some of the work in the field of meta-structures can be modeled and represented by soas and this will provide a straight forward way to teach students some of these contemporary concepts"

however adding large electrolyzer capacities to a low-carbon electricity system also increases the need for additional renewable electricity generation which will mostly come from variable renewable energies (vre) 
this will require hydrogen production to be variable unless sufficient flexibility is provided by other sources 
existing sources of flexibility in hydro-thermal systems are (a) hydropower and (b) thermal generation 
however increasing the flexibility of hydropower generation may have negative consequences for river ecosystems and the use of fossil and non-fossil fuels in generation may increase if thermal power is increasingly used to balance short-falls in wind power during electrolyzer operation 
we assess here for our swedish case study the utilization of electrolyzers with a dispatch model assuming that additional vre generation matches the additional electricity demand of hydrogen production on average 
the flexibility of hydropower and thermal generation is restricted in four scenarios and we run our model for 29 different weather years to test the impact of variable weather regimes 
we show that (a) in all scenarios electrolyzer utilization is above 60% on average (b) the inter-annual variability of hydrogen production is very high if thermal power is not dispatched for electrolysis (c) this problem is aggravated if hydropower flexibility is also restricted and therefore (d) either long-term storage of hydrogen backup hydrogen sources or additional flexibility measures may be necessary to guarantee continuous hydrogen flows and (e) adding wind power and electrolysis decreases the need for other backup flexibility measures in the system during climatic extreme events"

understanding how prostheses are used in everyday life is central to the design provision and evaluation of prosthetic devices and associated services this paper reviews the scientific literature on methodologies and technologies that have been used to assess the daily use of both upper- and lower-limb prostheses it discusses the types of studies that have been undertaken the technologies used to monitor physical activity the benefits of monitoring daily living and the barriers to long-term monitoring
methods
a systematic literature search was conducted in pubmed web of science scopus cinahl and embase of studies that monitored the activity of prosthesis-users during daily-living
results
60 lower-limb studies and 9 upper-limb studies were identified for inclusion in the review the first studies in the lower-limb field date from the 1990s and the number has increased steadily since the early 2000s in contrast the studies in the upper-limb field have only begun to emerge over the past few years the early lower-limb studies focused on the development or validation of actimeters algorithms and/or scores for activity classification however most of the recent lower-limb studies used activity monitoring to compare prosthetic components the lower-limb studies mainly used step-counts as their only measure of activity focusing on the amount of activity not the type and quality of movements in comparison the small number of upper-limb studies were fairly evenly spread between development of algorithms comparison of everyday activity to clinical scores and comparison of different prosthesis user populations most upper-limb papers reported the degree of symmetry in activity levels between the arm with the prosthesis and the intact arm
conclusions
activity monitoring technology used in conjunction with clinical scores and user feedback offers significant insights into how prostheses are used and whether they meet the user‚Äôs requirements however the cost limited battery-life and lack of availability in many countries mean that using sensors to understand the daily use of prostheses and the types of activity being performed has not yet become a feasible standard clinical practice this review provides recommendations for the research and clinical communities to advance this area for the benefit of prosthesis users"

background: finite element (fe) modelling has long been proposed to support the design of prosthetics sockets however there is minimal detail in the literature to inform practice in developing and interpreting these complex highly non-linear models 
objectives: to identify recommendations for best practice in fe modelling of lower limb prosthetics considering key modelling approaches and inputs
methods: this study developed a parametric fe model using mri data from a transtibial amputee sensitivity analyses were performed upon socket loading methods socket-residuum interface parameters and soft tissue material models from the literature to quantify their effect on the biomechanical response of the residual limb to a range of parameterised socket designs 
results: it was found that these variables had a marked impact on the predicted response of the fe model especially with regards to the interfacial pressure and shear distribution 
conclusions: all modelling decisions should be justified biomechanically and clinically:
- consider the effects of donning and interface friction to capture the shear stresses 
- use representative stiffness hyperelastic material models for soft tissues when using strain to predict injury; and 
- interrogate models comparatively against a clinically-used control 
- justification of these modelling decisions within a clinical reference frame"

research question: do spatiotemporal gait parameters measured using theia3d markerless motion capture demonstrate concurrent validity with those measured using marker-based motion capture
methods: 30 healthy adult participants performed treadmill walking at self-selected speeds while 2d video and marker-based motion capture data were collected simultaneously kinematic-based gait events were used to measure nine spatiotemporal gait parameters from both systems independently the parameters were compared using their group means bland-altman methods pearson correlation coefficients paired-samples t-tests and intraclass correlation coefficients (icc(a-1) and icc(c-1))
results: group means between marker-based and markerless methods were indistinguishable across all nine gait parameters and the bland-altman plots showed no systematic biases or clinically meaningful differences between the systems pearson correlation coefficients indicated perfect or near-perfect correlation (r ‚â• 096) between systems for gait speed cadence step time step length stride length stride width and stance time and strong correlations (r ‚â• 087) for double-limb support time and swing time t-tests indicated differences in stance swing and double-limb support time parameters strong correlations were found for both iccs with the lowest being icc(a-1) of 084 for both double-limb support time and swing time
significance: the high level of agreement and correlation between both systems indicate that the theia3d markerless motion capture system is sufficiently accurate for measuring spatiotemporal gait parameters for research clinical and other uses the results presented here for healthy adults during treadmill walking do not necessarily reflect the performance of the markerless system under different conditions"

in that previous work the signal was a single unipolar chirped sinusoidal or square wave this paper introduces a new bitstream pc-caml transceiver architecture that combines two unipolar chirped signals referred to as the dual unipolar signal to form a single bipolar signal in the receiver (patent pending) this bipolar signal is mixed with the bipolar dllos in the in-phase (i) digital mixing and quadrature-phase (q) digital mixing channels for digital i/q demodulation for improved signal-to-noise ratio (snr) compared to that when using a single unipolar signal
the simulation results presented in this paper indicate an snr improvement for the dual unipolar chirped sinusoidal signal bitstream pc-caml compared to that of the unipolar chirped sinusoidal signal bitstream pc-caml (both with bipolar dllos and digital i/q demodulation) of from about 3 db to about 6 db for signals below the onset of receiver saturation and an improvement for maximum achievable snr of about 13 db if the receiver is allowed to saturate
the bitstream pc-caml with a dual unipolar signal and bipolar dllos with digital i/q demodulation architecture discussed in this paper adds complexity to the transmitter and receiver compared to the architectures presented in the previous papers whether or not this additional complexity is worth the improved snr will have to be decided as part of system trade studies for particular systems and their applications
however the new architecture still retains the key advantages of the previous bitstream pc-caml  architectures since it still replaces bulky power-hungry and expensive wideband rf analog electronics in the receiver with digital components that can be implemented in inexpensive silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cmos) read-out integrated circuits (roics) to make the bitstream pc-caml with a dllo more suitable for compact lidar-on-a-chip systems and lidar array receivers than previous standard pc-caml systems

the amplitude response and power generation performance are compared with the conventional point absorber considering both non-resonant and resonant buoy cases it is shown that by properly designing the tuning spring stiffness and generator damping the rotation of the generator can be amplified compared to the buoy increasing the power absorption drastically"

resupply by airdropping or drone-shipping is a new resupply strategy in backpacking in preparation for reconnaissance in long distance backpacking and sar activities in remote areas with little or no development we consider the use of amateur radio with gps beacons for resupply tracking
and geo-tagging 
while 6g communications using gps satellites are available for mountaineering beacons we use a dual strategy with an additional amateur radio based ax25 packet radio using the psat based cubesat for publishing location information
additionally two cargo itag locating satellites bot cubesats are also used for itag location and the automatic publication of tag locations on geocachingcom the satellites are aeneas and ptecsat
a logistics exercise is introduced proposed to be conducted at uncas scientific area near big lake mn with an operations logistik for the spanning of drop locations and radio fox hunt using a reconnaissance track mobile cache device
keywords: itag ibeacon amsat cubesat aeneas ptecsat 6g ax25 resupply mountaineering and backpacking sar

what: 
the amsat aeneas(‚Äútechnical details for satellite aeneas‚Äù nd) ptecsat(‚Äúiaru sat coordinator‚Äù nd) satellite is used for resupply ibeacon tracking with a payload of water sachets and soylent coffee packs for mountaineering resupply logistics radio fox hunting combined with alpining is defined as a newer ultralight backpacking technique
how:
ibeacons defining 100msec bursts at 2425ghz are designed with the minimum wattage needed for detection on the field by the aeneas satellite 100 such packages containing 1-liter pouches of potable water and three meals of soylent of 87 grams each this proof of concept study is to be conducted at uncas dunes scientific and natural area (sna) with an area of 6583 acres  we have a density of airdropping of 658 acres per package leading to an average distance of 2662832 square meters by pi/4 d^2 d is 184 meters in circle close packing model
we determine an optimal trajectory for the radio fox hunt over a published geotag distribution of 100 resupply caches


why:
resupply strategies form an important role in long distance mountaineering and backpacking missions for wilderness areas with little or no little development for example the pacific crest trail in the united states a strong resupply strategy along with an armada of reconnaissance track mobile caches are needed for effective mountaineering and/or search and rescue operations with a resilience plan for extreme weather operations
the use of 6g like simulated communication is possible by using better encryption and packet compression over a slower ax25 network with the use of ai based technologies like image cartoonization and feature representation and speech to text conversion for lower bandwidth requirements

so what:
the use of reconnaissance tracks along with airdropped resupply will improve the efficiency and quality of mountaineering and provide vital air support for search and rescue operations resupply beacons also provide supplies for hikers or backpackers lost in the wilderness and also provide emergency communication hotspots as the beacons are still active to transreceiver emergency messages"

many complex real world scenarios can be reduced to a simulation of a salesman trying to find the shortest (length) hamiltonian (cycle) route in a euclidean super-graph g* if each city-node is modeled as a input symbol in a communication channel represented by an output pair with consistent probabilities distribution thus an polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm can use this information to improve the solution quality at the same rate of transmission of information over the channel
in this paper we explore an quantitative stochastic process based in algorithm information theory and the shannon-kelly criterion to find valid near optimal solutions using a new growth- optimal strategy applied to the tsp problem that have statistically significant transmission rate even when no encoding scheme is available regardless of time-complexity of the problem
previous heuristics such as 2 opt genetic algorithms (ga) and simulated annealing (sa) approach‚Äôs the tsp problem by relying on a priori knowledge about the data distribution in order to reduce the probability of error in finding the best candidate solution tour
in this work we propose a method that models the solution space boundaries of the tsp problem as a communication channel by means of information theory we describe a search algorithm that check for patterns (ie information content) in the elements of a constrained solution space modeled as messages transmitted through communication systems the boundaries of the search space are defined by the kolmogorov complexity of the candidate solutions sequences we conclude with an discussion about the quality of the results and implications for general decision problem in turing machines"

422,13.0,0.5469,"work, activity, user, wind, type, cost, include, location, platform, order","this thesis studies the dynamic route and transport mode optimization for participating in a jointly decided activity subject to spatio-temporal variations joint activity participants have to travel from their current locations to a common location which is the location of the joint activity apart from the recurrent joint activities (such as work school etc) there are several joint leisure activities where activity participants have to decide about the location and the starting time of the joint leisure activity along with the transport mode(s) that each one of them has to use for commuting from his/her current location to the joint leisure activity location

the objective of this thesis is the development of a comprehensive system for the optimization of joint leisure trips that are not related to work by optimizing (a) the location and the starting time of the joint leisure activity (b) the public transport operations (c) the transport mode(s) selection for each activity participant in order to arrive there as fast as possible while satisfying his/her personal trip preferences

activities not related to work can be responsible for more than 60\% of trips at an urban environment non-working travel patterns differ from the more stable recurrent travel patterns of work-related activities such as trips from/to work school etc and the three main differences of those activities are: (1) the location of a leisure activity can differ on a daily basis (it is not static like the location of the working or studying place); (2) the starting time of a leisure activity has greater elasticity and can differ on a daily basis (it is not stable such as the starting time of work school etc); (3) the alternative journey options to and from a leisure activity location are not well-known to the users (users are more aware of their journey alternatives when it comes to transfers from/to work-related activities since those activities are re-current) 
 
given that a significant number of transfers is related to leisure activities the optimization of the (1) location selection (2) starting activity time (3) transport mode selection and (4) route selection are of paramount importance for both the commuters' total travel cost and the transport network performance in addition the prediction of non-recurrent activities in time and space can be an important step forward for the tactical and dynamic planning of transport networks since the volume and the non-recurrent nature of such activities lead to significant travel demand variations compared to the more stable work-related activities 

due to the above this thesis focuses on: (i) understanding the state-of-the-art (soa) work on utilizing user-generated data for increasing the efficiency level of joint leisure activities and proposing actions towards this direction; (ii) capturing users' willingness to travel certain distances for participating in different types of activities; (iii) optimizing the selection of locations and starting times of joint leisure activities (iv) re-scheduling the starting times of public transportation trips in order to adjust to the joint leisure activity demand without deteriorating the quality of service (qos) for other passengers; (v) optimizing the journey/path selection of users' who are willing to travel from one point of the network to another for participating at one activity and possibly utilize multiple modes while also satisfying their preferences"

* community service is voluntary work intended to help people in a particular community 
* social responsibility is an obligation that an individual (or company) has to act with concern and sensitivity aware of the impacts of their own action on others particularly the disadvantaged 
* social justice relates to the distribution of the advantages and disadvantages in society including the way in which they are allocated 
* pro bono- work done without compensation (pay) for the public good 

this course specifically addresses the issues described above with the goal of providing early exposure to topics that will be reinforced in non-major coursework such as general education elective courses results showed that there was little change in student perceptions before and after completion of the course in terms of their perceptions of ethics social responsibility and social justice in the areas in which there were statistically significant changes students were on average slightly less sure the engineering profession can help people or solve social issues and slightly less interested in a job that involves helping people on the other hand students were slightly more aware after the course of the need to include social aspects in engineering practice and rated technical and professional skills as slightly less important after the class it was also found that some groups in the class (women minority students first-generation students and student less focused on salary in thinking about their future jobs) entered the class with different attitudes and changed in different ways by the end of the course overall the results of this survey support other findings in engineering ethics which suggests that one course is insufficient to make significant impacts on the ways engineering students think about the societal implications of their work however these declines in student confidence while small are important to take seriously and this paper will draw out potential implications of this finding finally we will discuss the implications of the differences within the class in terms of effective teaching of these topics and retention of underrepresented students"

the construction of these domed monoliths follow a simple geometrical pattern based on the use of compasses hence the form and other building characteristics can be parametric this is a system of equations for these building‚Äôs physical dimensions can be derived based on initial parameters
these equation‚Äôs variables can be divided into independent ('constructive') and dependent ('observable') and by defining the values of the independent parameters (sack dimensions radius of base (internal compass) radius of roof (external compass) radius of skylight dimensions of openings mean material specific weight mean material elastic modulus mean friction coefficient between rows etc) resulting dimensions and mechanical behaviors such as building height interior habitable area proportion of rows that rest upon the previous or total building weight maximum shear force amongst all rows axial stresses etc can be determined
this article deals with the resulting geometrical dimensions of the building given corresponding initial parameters if we were to set some dependent variables as fixed values we could solve the system of equations for the missing independent parameters this would allow for example to set design values for building weight and height and to determine the unknown values for the corresponding radiuses and necessary sack dimensions which will produce a building that meets this pre requisites

frequently used as structural elements in the both the civil and aerospace industry structure
made of these materials display high acoustic impedances along the direction of the fibers but

anisotropic structures when transducers are coupled in a direction orthogonal to the resonant
mode they display significantly lower characteristic impedance than if coupled in the same

however existing approaches have focused on the electrical supply side ignoring the obvious link between the user and the grid: individual hot water consumption patterns 
this paper proposes a load spreading approach in which water heaters compete for access to the heating medium 
the proposed smart grid solution takes grid load limits real-time temperature measurements water usage patterns individual user comfort and heater meta-data into consideration 
the scheduler only turns on the heaters with the highest level of need but limits the number of on heaters to ensure that the grid load stays below a set limit for a set time 
the method is evaluated by simulation against various heater set temperature levels and for various load limits and compared with ripple control and actual consumption measured in a field trial of 34 water heaters 
the proposed algorithm reduces the load from 62kw to 20 30 40 and 50kw (vs 106kw for full ripple control) the resulting number of unwanted cold events is fewer than for ripple control and only slightly more than no control while reducing the total energy by 14% from a user-optimised natural experiment"

first new land-efficient technologies for renewable fuel production become increasingly available and technically allow for long-distance trade in renewables second regional differences in social acceptance and land availability for energy infrastructure support the development of renewable fuel import and export streams third the economics of renewable energy systems ie the different production conditions globally and the high costs of fully renewable regional electricity systems will create opportunities for spatial arbitrage fourth the reduction of stranded investments in the fossil fuel sector is possible by switching from fossil fuel to renewable fuel trade in exporting regions

methods: a sequential cohort of tibial shaft fracture patients was prospectively recruited for observation following standard reamed intramedullary nailing in a level i trauma center follow-ups at 6 12 18 and 24 weeks included x-rays and completion of proms (eq-5d and pain scores) low-dose computed-tomography (ct) scans were also completed at 12 weeks scans were reconstructed in 3d and subjected to virtual mechanical testing via the finite element method to assess fracture limb torsional rigidity relative to intact bone
results: patients reported progressive longitudinal improvement in mobility self-care activity and health over time but the proms were not correlated with structural bone healing rust scoring showed moderate intra-rater agreement (icc = 0727) but the scores at 12 weeks were not correlated with time to union (r2 = 0103 p = 0193) and were only moderately correlated with callus structural integrity (r2 = 0346 p = 0010) in contrast patient-specific virtual torsional rigidity (vtr) was significantly correlated with time to union (r2 = 0383 p = 0005) and clearly differentiated one case of delayed union (vtr = 10% union at 8 months) from the rest of the normally healing cohort (vtr &gt; 60% median union time 19 weeks) using ct data alone
conclusions: proms provide insight into the natural history of the patient experience after tibial fracture but have limited utility as a measure of structural bone healing rust scoring although repeatable is not a valid longitudinal predictor of time to union in contrast virtual mechanical testing from low-dose ct scans provides a quantitative and objective structural callus assessment that reliably predicts time to union and may enable early diagnosis of compromised healing

study design: ex vivo experimental

sample population: sixty-four tension band wiring constructs

methods: four tension band configurations were applied to a metal trochanteric osteotomy model based on a canine femur: figure-of-eight with one twist (ot) figure-of-eight with two twists (tt) dual interlocking single loop (disl) and double loop (dl) configurations were mechanically tested under both monotonic loading (n = 8 per configuration) and incremental cyclic loading (n = 8 per configuration) initial tension after tying residual tension remaining after each cycle and failure load at 2 mm of displacement (considered equivalent to clinical failure) were recorded 

results: the initial tension and the load to 2 mm of displacement was lower for ot wires compared to tt wires the dl was the strongest and most stable configuration generating greater initial tension maintaining a greater percentage of residual tension under incremental cyclic loads and resisting higher load before failure at 2 mm failure load was highly correlated with initial tension 

conclusion: this model enabled evaluation of tension band wire configuration independent of the fixation pin portion of the construct wire configurations that can be tightened to a greater tension during tying like the dl are better able to resist the tensile loads experienced by the construct 

clinical impact: in clinical situations where high tensile loads are expected a tighter more secure tension band wire configuration may be warranted"

in this study a two dimensional finite flement (fe) model of knee joint under standard arthrometry state (by a kt-2000 arthrometer) was built this model was then used to evaluate the effect of precise modeling of tibiofemoral contact-surface geometry with considering flexible articular cartilage in the joint the results revealed that exact modeling of the contact geometry highly influences the simulation results in the next step the built model was used in a stochastic modeling with the experimental data obtained from literature in order to simulate a real diagnosis circumstance and to provide a statistical comparison between seven different levels of acl injury the result of this simulation shows that although arthrometry may be able to distinguish partial injuries from intact in most cases leading to less acld with appropriate treatment but it is hard to tell anything about the level of injury to prevent the costs of imaging techniques moving towards the introduction of new measuring methods (or newly defined identifiers) or using intelligent processing of currently obtained data is suggested"

we develop an efficient multiscale modeling method whereby the rve analyses are only called at specialized locations by multiscale elements and run parallel with the global analysis the constitutive models of multiscale elements are defined in a user-defined element subroutine (uel) where stiffnesses of the multiscale elements are unknown at the beginning of the analysis they can only be obtained by performing a series of rve analyses for each set of loads received from the global analysis the advantage of the proposed method is that the stiffnesses of the multiscale elements are directly computed from the rve analyses and keep updated for each global load increment the nested multiscale modeling is implemented by python script and highly capable for nonlinear analysis of composite structures"

while maintaining relatively high rejections of multivalent ions in spite of their great potential our understanding
as to what makes them superior has been limited demanding further investigation before any
large-scale implementation can be realized in this study the donnan-steric pore model with dielectric
exclusion (dspm-de) is applied for the first time to these membranes to describe the membrane separation
performance and to explain the observed rejection trends including negative rejection and their underlying
multi-ionic interactions experiments were conducted on a spectrum of feed chemistries ranging from
uncharged solutes to single salts salt mixtures and artificial seawater to characterize the membrane and
accurately predict its performance modeling results were validated with experiments and then used to
elucidate the working principles that underlie the low-pressure softening process an approach based on
sensitivity analysis shows that the membrane pore dielectric constant followed by the pore size are primarily
responsible for the selectively high rejections of the nf membranes to multivalent ions surprisingly
the softening process is found to be less sensitive to changes in membrane charge density our findings
demonstrate that the unique ability of these membranes to exclusively separate multivalent ions from the
solution while allowing monovalent ions to permeate is key to making this low-pressure softening process

laparoscopic surgery that is commonly associated with the linea alba
however the few studies on the mechanical properties of the linea alba in
the literature appear contradictory possible due to challenges with the
physical dimensions of samples and variations in protocol this study
focuses on the tensile mechanical characterisation of the porcine linea
alba as determined by uniaxial and equi-load biaxial testing using
image-based strain measurement methods results show that the linea alba
demonstrated a non-linear elastic anisotropic behaviour which is often
observed in biological soft tissues the transverse direction (parallel to
fibres) was found to be approximately 8 times stiffer than the longitudinal
(cross-fibre) direction under both uniaxial and equi-load biaxial loading
the equi-load biaxial tensile tests revealed that contraction could occur
in the transverse direction despite increasing load probably due to the
anisotropy of the tissue optical surface marker tracking and digital image
correlation methods were found to greatly improve the accuracy of stretch
measurement resulting in a 75% change in the apparent stiffness compared
to using strain derived from machine cross-head displacement additionally
a finite element model of the experiments using a combination of an ogden
and fibre exponential power law model for the linea alba was implemented to
quantify the effect of clamping and tissue dimensions (which are suboptimal
for tensile testing) on the results the preliminary model results were
used to apply a correction factor to the uniaxial experimental data prior
to inverse optimisation to derive best fit material parameters for the
fibre reinforced ogden model application of the model to the equi-load

euclidian space using scalar vector and tensor-valued quantities usually
up to the order of four for their numerical treatment it is common
practice to transform the relations into a matrix-vector format this
transformation is usually performed using the so-called voigt mapping this
mapping does not preserve tensor character leaving significant room for
error as stress and strain quantities follow from different mappings and
thus have to be treated differently in certain mathematical operations
despite its conceptual and notational difficulties having been pointed out
the voigt mapping remains the foundation of most current finite element
programmes an alternative is the so-called kelvin mapping which has
recently gained recognition in studies of theoretical mechanics this
article is concerned with benefits of the kelvin mapping in numerical
modelling tools such as finite element software the decisive difference to
the voigt mapping is that kelvin‚Äôs method preserves tensor character and
thus the numerical matrix notation directly corresponds to the original
tensor notation further benefits in numerical implementations are that
tensor norms are calculated identically without distinguishing stress or
strain-type quantities and tensor equations can be directly transformed
into matrix equations without additional considerations the only
implementational changes are related to a scalar factor in certain finite
element matrices and hence harvesting the mentioned benefits comes at very
little cost"

to enable the design of a fluid powered surgical robot it was first necessary to identify the design requirements for a robot of this nature as well as the considerations unique to this approach to this end a quantification of the necessary load capacity for natural orifice robots was conducted further through a review of the literature in the fields of surgery and robotics considerations of necessary workspace and limitations for the prevention of tissue damage were explored the results of these analyses are presented

the technologies that comprise this novel surgical robotic system include a hydraulic control valve actuation units and an enabling structure the intended application of these technologies introduced numerous limitations and challenges to the design process the most stringent of these limitations was that of overall size due to the realities of patient anatomy which prevented the use of commercially available hydraulic components an assemblage of components to achieve the aforementioned design requirements is described including the design of a novel hydraulic control valve to enable manipulation of three actuators using a single valve sized to fit within the working channel of a surgical endoscope

the advantage of the described approach is that the device enables greater miniaturization improves cost effectiveness and has better ease of mobility the mobility and the relaxed requirements for operating room cleanliness can be potentially useful for mobile clinics out-patient clinical settings and on the battlefield being more cost effective and having a small overall size the robotic assisted surgical devices can be widely deployed even in rural or other less technology intensive environments through careful review of the literature and analytical evaluation of the various proposed concepts it was possible to arrive at a design that meets the needs of modern surgical interventions while addressing the perceived limitations of existing surgical robotics

through the efforts described in this dissertation much new information was produced and developments resulted the considerations of hydraulic power for surgical robots were evaluated and are applicable to other surgical tasks where hydraulic power may be used advantageously a quantification of the load requirements for surgical robots performing abdominal procedures was produced which will provide a guide for other researchers developing surgical robots these values are difficult to find in the literature and are a valuable resource for the field an alternative simplified model for predicting the behavior of continuum beams under load was developed to provide an inverse formulation for computing beam shape and end loads this is useful as continuum beams are widely used for minimally invasive surgical manipulators as well as in a wide variety of other applications finally a novel valve concept and two possible designs realizing this concept were developed these valve designs facilitate control over the three actuators in an antagonistic arrangement further the valve designs enable proportional control of the three actuators at a size scale not commercially available in summary the design of a novel hydraulic surgical manipulator as a summation of its parts has been performed this design demonstrates the feasibility of the fluid power approach to embedded minimally invasive surgical robotics the pursuit of this research has provided many unique challenges and the work presented here has addressed many of them as well as laid the foundation for future developments in the application of hydraulic power to the growing field of surgical robotics for minimally invasive surgery"

997,19.0,0.37,"design, engineering, student, project, study, work, find, paper, include, designer",the micro-blogging platform twitter has been employed by some in higher education as a tool for enhanced student engagement this platform has shown promise as an educational tool for the promotion of critical reading and writing and concise expression of ideas however it is unclear in what settings and under what circumstances twitter can be effectively employed in the engineering classroom these questions were explored over a multi-semester study of student participation in directed social media discussions within the engineering classroom the various cohorts of students included in this study were drawn from engineering courses comparisons were made between these multiple cohorts on the basis of active engagement in the assigned tasks performance on homework and examinations and overall course performance through the process of using this practice in the classroom it was found that there was difficulty encouraging engineering students to participate in twitter discussions regardless of the incentive provided limited evidence was found of greater course achievement correlating with greater participation in twitter based tasks it is expected that greater effort is required in familiarizing students with the twitter platform and increasing their comfort level with asking questions and carrying out discussions in a public forum
998,19.0,0.4181,"design, engineering, student, project, study, work, find, paper, include, designer",through the use of service learning in higher education universities hope to both provide real benefit to the partnering community and allow students to develop a greater understanding of course curriculum their discipline and their personal positioning within society through these educational activities service learning seeks to engage students in critical thinking processes while simultaneously achieving a greater sense of civic and social responsibility through targeted participation in meaningful community service activities however in practice service learning can take a variety of forms predicated on technical cultural societal and political constraints thus while some work shows positive effects on students' attitudes social behaviour and academic performance less research has demonstrated long-term community impact nor has much research shown that participation in service learning has a long-term impact on students' ethical perspectives and frameworks and whether those ethical frames carry on to their professional careers moreover as institutions partner with such humanitarian service groups as engineers without borders usa we know considerably less about the institutional cultures and climates that are developed through such partnerships and how sustainable they are given those inherent technical political and cultural limitations as a first step towards these goals this paper proposes a methodology for investigating the impacts of service learning activities on both the students and communities involved
999,19.0,0.4234,"design, engineering, student, project, study, work, find, paper, include, designer",traditional engineering education often falls short when it comes to the inclusion of issues related to social justice ethics and globalization while engineering programs are required to include ethics content for accreditation most seem to rely primarily on general education electives providing only a high-level overview and including the bare minimum in the program core this can lead to an inconsistent student experience and minimal exposure to topics which are critically important for achieving worldwide equity and operating responsibly in the engineering workplace given the role that engineers play in economic development this is unacceptable it is therefore the responsibility of engineering educators to find a better way to shape the future of the engineering profession this paper outlines the early efforts at integrating the topics of ethics social justice and social responsibility more directly into the engineering curriculum this is approached from the perspectives of pedagogy curriculum development and service learning opportunities  it is within this context that the authors hope to influence students' awareness of and connection to social and environmental issues as well as the ethical frameworks they develop and carry with them into their professional careers this paper centers around the creation and delivery of a new introductory engineering course combining liberal education topics and introductory engineering topics this course also includes a substantial design project which incorporates a cultural engagement component through collaboration with international partners the first offering of this new course revealed that while some reservations persist students found value in exploring what it means to be an engineer in a broader global context
